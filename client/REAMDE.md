There are multiple problems to solve, 1 at a time.
1. Bloom filter implementation: 
	1. Looking at 4 different hash functions for the bloom filter, and benchmarking performance: CRC, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512
    2. Bloom filter will have insert and lookup
	3. Will be persisted to a memory mapped file
